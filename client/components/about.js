          Welcome!
          <br />
          <br />
          As a past leader in nonprofit fundraising - soliciting and securing
          large scale investments from major donors - I discovered my love for
          creating efficiencies and solving problems for my team through
          technology, which led me to code.
          <br />
          <br />
          I just graduated from the Grace Hopper Program at the Fullstack
          Academy of Code in early September 2019 with full stack JavaScript
          skills. Now as a software engineer, Iâ€™m looking for front-end,
          back-end, or fullstack opportunities on a team of innovative and
          ambitious engineers with the goal to leverage technology to have a
          positive and lasting impact on the lives of many.
          <br />
          <br />
          I look forward to connecting with you!
          <br />
          <br />
          -Juliana
